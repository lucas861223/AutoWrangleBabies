# AutoWrangleBabies
An Oxygen Not Included Mod

This mod allows dupes to auto-wrangle babies. This ONLY affects auto-wrangle.

For some reason, critter drop-offs' auto-wrangle setting only applies to adult critters in the base game, so you'd either have to manually wrangle babies, or wait 5 cycles for them to become adults. That feels more like a bug than a feature.
